# A Pirate's Tale - FMP 2022
This is a game developed for my Culture brief; it's a pirate narrative adventure game where you play as a discharged ex-military who becomes a pirate. You will relive the character's past experiences through his journal entries as you continue reliving the past events; you will live by the pirate code, which highly contrasts with the political system, and you will comment on the corruption and injustice within the government.
